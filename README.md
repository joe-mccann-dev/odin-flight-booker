This project is an exercise in building advanced forms completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms). It is a flight-booker app in which hypothetical passengers can search for one way flights to or from airports selected from a dropdown. After viewing available flights, they can then select a flight to book and enter their information. This is done via nested forms, which requires whitelisting the nested attributes.
